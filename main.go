// Congrats! You've just linked through to some code from your Notebook!
// The repo was cloned to your machine, the file opened and the lines highlighted automatically, pretty cool right?
//
// Things to try:
// - Notebook code block links find the code even after it's moved!
//   Add a few lines to this description and click the "Open in..." link in the Notebook again.
//   Note the same code block is still highlighed, even after it's moved.
// - Select the `selectMe` function below and hit cmd+shift+p to add the snippet to a Notebook.
// - Return to the welcome Notebook to keep following the instructions there.
// Happy coding!
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}

// Drag your cursor over this code and hit cmd+shift+p or alt+p to add it to a playbook
func selectMe() {
