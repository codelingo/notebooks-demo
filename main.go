// Congrats! You've just linked through to some code from your welcome playbook!
// The repo was cloned to your machine, the file opened and the lines highlighted automatically, pretty cool right?
//
// Things to try:
// - Playbook code block links find the code even after it's moved!
//   Add a few lines to this description and click the "Open in..." link in the playbook again.
//   Note the same code block is still highlighed, even after it's moved.
// - Change the "hello world" to something else, note the code updates in the playbook.
// - Select some code and hit cmd+shift+p to add your own code snippet to a playbook
// - Return to the welcome playbook to keep following the instructions there
// Happy coding!
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
